# Session 1 Assignment ‚Äì Vibe Check

## üèóÔ∏è Activity #1: Vibe Check Evaluation

Below are the results of conducting a "vibe check" on my **LLM API/SDK Generator** app:  
- GitHub Repo: [llm-api-sdk-generator](https://github.com/madhupathy/llm_api_sdk_generator)  
- Frontend (Vercel): [https://llm-api-sdk-generator.vercel.app/](https://llm-api-sdk-generator.vercel.app/)  
- Backend (Render): [https://llm-api-backend.onrender.com/](https://llm-api-backend.onrender.com/)

### 1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.  
- **Aspect Tested:** Ability to explain technical concepts simply.  
- **Performance:** The system provided a clear analogy (blueprints/objects) but was slightly technical. Overall understandable for beginners.  

---

### 2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points.  
- **Aspect Tested:** Summarization and information compression.  
- **Performance:** The app generated a solid summary, capturing the main ideas but sometimes leaving out minor supporting details. Effective for quick overviews.  

---

### 3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.  
- **Aspect Tested:** Creativity, coherence, and adherence to word count.  
- **Performance:** The response was creative and engaging, with a logical flow. Word length was close to range but occasionally slightly under/over 150 words.

### 4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?  
- **Aspect Tested:** Logical reasoning and basic math.  
- **Performance:** Correct answer provided (**3 packs of apples, 3 packs of oranges**). Reliable for straightforward math.  

---

### 5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone.  
- **Aspect Tested:** Style transfer and tone refinement.  
- **Performance:** Successfully rewrote the paragraph into a polished and formal tone while preserving meaning.

## ‚ùì Question #1: Limitations of Vibe Checking  

‚úÖ **Answer:**  
Vibe checking is quick and useful for catching obvious issues but has clear limitations:  
- It is **subjective** and may differ between evaluators.  
- It provides only a **snapshot**, not comprehensive coverage.  
- It lacks **quantitative metrics** (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  
- It may **miss systematic weaknesses**, since only a handful of scenarios are tested.

## üöß Advanced Build (Optional)  

**Adjustments Made:**  
- Strengthened system prompts to enforce length limits.  
- Added instruction to simplify technical explanations for non-technical users.  

**Results:**  
- Improved clarity for beginners (OOP explanation easier to understand).  
- Word count of creative writing tasks became tighter and closer to range.  
- Style transfer remained consistent.

## üö¢ Build ‚Äì Ship ‚Äì Share  

### 3 Lessons Learned  
1. Prompt clarity has a huge impact on output quality.  
2. LLMs are strong at summarization and rewriting but can drift on word count.  
3. Deployment (Vercel + Render) requires careful environment setup.  

### 3 Lessons Not Yet Learned  
1. How to handle hallucinations in generated API schemas.  
2. How to measure LLM evaluation systematically (beyond vibe checks).  
3. How to optimize latency and scalability for larger workloads.
